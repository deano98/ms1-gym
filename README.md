# UX

### The users this website will be targeting:
* Potential new members
* Current members

The website will be easy to navigate for all users. The gym itself has a modern and clean aesthetic - the website will share a similar theme to visually compliment this. 

Responsive design is employed to provide a smooth experience on any device.
