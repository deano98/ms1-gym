# Milestone Fitness

This website is for a fictional gym called Milestone Fitness, created for my first milestone project. It includes a timetable for classes, membership pricing, information about the gym and how to find it. The aim of the website is to attract new members by showing off the facilites and providing all the necessary information.

### Business Goals
* Attract more members 
* Increase awareness of the facility

### Customer Goals
* Signing up to a Gym
* Simple way to view and sign up for classes
* Find information on pricing, opening times and location

# UX

### The users this website will be targeting:
* Potential new members
* Current members

The website will be easy to navigate for all users. The gym itself has a modern and clean aesthetic - the website will share a similar theme to visually compliment this. 

Responsive design is employed to provide a smooth experience on any device.

# Design

### Typography

* The two fonts used on the website are Lato and Raleway, a pairing recommended by Google. The fonts have a clean and modern look and will complement the theme of the Gym perfectly. Sans Serif will be a substitute if the chosen fonts don't work.

### Colour Scheme

* The main colours that will feature on the website are Gunmetal, White and Light blue - This was a combination recommended by ColorSpace

# Features

All pages include a navigation bar at the top, with links to each page on the site. A footer will also feature on each page, displaying social media icons with links to the corresponding site.

## Homepage

The homepage uses an eye catching hero image to capture the users intrigue. Below that, information on the features of the gym / membership packages are concisely displayed, complimented with smaller images showing off the equipment. The goal of the homepage is to impact the user and get them interested in joining. 

## Classes

The classes page provides the user with all the information on the classes scheduled for that week. There are 3 sessions per day, each displayed with a suitable image - the details will be on the image in a contrasting coloured font. The desktop and tablet versions will have the 3 images presented horizontally across the screen for each day. On the mobile version, the pictures will be flattened and displayed vertically down the screen.

## Membership

The membership page features all the information on the membership packages available. If the user is interested in joining, we want all the details they require to be concise and easy to find. There are 3 packages which are presented horizontally accross the screen, vertically on tablet or mobile.

## Contact

The contact page has a similar layout to the membership page, providing users with the folowing information: Opening times, contact details and a link to a feedback form. The page also includes a map showing the location of the facility. The info is presented horizontally on desktop, switching to vertically for tablet and mobile.
