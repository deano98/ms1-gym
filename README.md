# Design

## Bug Fixes

* Fixed a bug on which involved the divs on the membership page detailing the packages, and the divs on the contact page showing the contact infomation. On smaller resolutions, the rightmost div would fall underneath the other 2, causing impact to the layout of the page. This was due to the border used for the vertical lines adding to the size of the element. Adding the property box-sizing with a value of border-box made it so that the border is now inside the element instead of outside. The 33% width of the divs is now unaffected by the border.
